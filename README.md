##Build a portfolio site


###Instructions:

<ul>
  <li>Download the design mockup file from the Downloadables section (in the lower right hand corner of your screen, just below this text) and review it.
  <li>Identify the various boxes you will need to build in order to recreate this design.
  <li>Write your HTML and CSS files, continue to iterate until your work is representative of the design mockup.
  <li>Take the time to personalize your portfolio with custom colors, additional content and your own images.
  <li>Validate your HTML and CSS against the W3C's Validators. Note: the validators consider the following errors, whereas Udacity accepts these errors as acceptable:
  <li>HTML5: Bad value X-UA-Compatible for attribute http-equiv on element meta when using the X-UA-Compatible meta tag.
  <li>CSS3: Property [some property here] is an unknown vendor extension when using vendor prefixed properties (like -moz-box-sizing).
</ul>

###Code review and feedback from Udacity coach

* Good ones
  * Excellent job using semantic tags! Here is a small article that goes into the advantages of why to use semantic tags :) You can use the following image as a guide to layout your semantic tags in the future
  * I would encourage you to also use navigation bar, additional javascript functionality, Polymer Components, etc . Apart from this I really liked your sense of design and the sort of images that you chose. Really livened up the webpage! Keep at it you will be a front end ninja in no time :)
  * Excellent job at using srcset. One of the few projects I have seen here that have used it. Very impressed :)
  * Good job on this! A lot of people starting out make a mistake of including style tags in their HTML. Keeping your style and HTML seperate will help you a lot when you have to work on large projects :)
  * There are few easily fixable errors in your CSS that I have marked in the code review. Just fix them and you will be good to go :) On the other hand your HTML validation is perfect! Good job :) Also it is a good idea to use the HTML and CSS validators before you submit your files :)

* Need to be fixed
  * always prefer to have double quotes for your property values :)
  * always prefer to start your selectors from a new line. So this would be
    h1,
    h2,
    h3,
  * you do not need to use any units if the value is 0 :)


###Reflections:

* I should consider optimization issue to achieve true responsiveness.
* Get used to massage CSS and build html structure.
* I learned how to use Grunt.
* I learned how to use Picturefill.
* I'll log how I feel and think to this README file while I code.
* I learned how to use git and github in addition to host my project via github.
* I should put comments more than this.
* I like to focus to change last 1 pixel.
